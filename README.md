# Transfermarkt Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes data from Transfermarkt, a popular website for football transfer information. The goal is to perform statistical analyses and train machine learning models using the scraped data.

The project begins with the data scraping process, where relevant information is extracted from Transfermarkt. To ensure compatibility with the analysis implementations, a well-defined database schema is designed. The scraped data is then stored in the database for further analysis.

The project encompasses the following steps:

1. **Scraping the Required Data**: This step involves extracting the necessary data from Transfermarkt using web scraping techniques. Various attributes such as player details and team information are collected.

2. **Design, Implementation, and Storage of Data in the Database**: A suitable database schema accommodates the scraped data. This schema is implemented, and the collected data is stored in the database for efficient querying and analysis in subsequent steps.

3. **Statistical Analyses**: The collected data is subjected to various statistical analyses to gain insights and uncover patterns. This may include calculating player statistics, team performance metrics, transfer trends, or any other relevant analysis.

4. **Machine Learning Model Training**: Building upon statistical analysis, machine learning models are developed to predict specific outcomes or make informed decisions based on the available data. This step involves feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.
